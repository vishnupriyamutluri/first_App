 <h1>favorite place is Ooty</h1>
 <p>Summer Vacation is the time for fun and enjoyment. We plan trips during summer vacation every year. We stay in Madurai and our place was very hot this Summer. We planned to visit a good hill station and spend time with our family. We went in a van with all our cousins’ family. It was great entertainment touring and staying with everyone. We stayed in a resort for 3 days. We visited all famous destinations in Ooty. The best experience was the flower show. It was overwhelming to see so many colorful all at a time in one single place. </p>

<h1>Favorite heroine is Kalpana Chawala</h1>
<p>Chawla's first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, "You are just your intelligence." Chawla had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth. On her first mission, Chawla traveled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.[18][7] During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation exonerated [19] Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces[20] and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control. After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.</p>

<h1>Favorite actor is Surya</h1>
<p>He was not a bright student during his school or college days. After his studies, he worked in a garment factory for about three years without revealing his father’s identity. Later when he was offered a role in Vasanth’s film “Aasai (1995)“, he rejected it due to lack of interest and confidence in acting. Later, he was introduced by another Vasanth’s film “Nerrukku Ner (1997)” directed by Mani Rathnam when he was 22 years of age. Director Mani Ratnam gave his stage name Suriya to avoid any confusions with the established actor Saravanan. This movie became a hit and gave a good start to him.</p>
